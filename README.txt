VLCia is a small mediaplayer for your media files on the SIA network.
For VLCia to work Siad must be up and running.
VLCia (should) work(s) on Windows, Linux and macOS. 

Known bugs:
1. Streaming the media file only really stops when stop button is pressed.
2. Stop button will sometimes stop the whole program.
3. Refresh can only be clicked once per startup. (Done deliberatly so it wont create duplicates in the dropdown menu)
4. Only works if sia runs on port 9980.
5. Native mediaplayer won't work on macOS due to a current bug in libvlcsharp.
